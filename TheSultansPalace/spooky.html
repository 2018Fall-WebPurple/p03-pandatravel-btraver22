        <p>If you are looking for the scare of your lifetime, you should visit The Sultan's Palace, <i> <b> if you dare! </b></i></p>

        <!-- This is the beginning of the body paragraph. I used <b></b> and <i></i> to make certain words stand out. -->
        
        <p> This spooky setting is located at <b> 716 Dauphine Street </b> in New Orleans, Lousiana. It is the exact spot where Jean LePrete, a wealthy man, lent his mansion to a Sultan and his brother. During the night a man dared to walk across the front lawn of the palace, and was shocked to look and see blood dripping down the front steps. When officers arrived and opened the door, they found corpses scattered around the huge house. The most shocking sight was laying in the backyard, where officers say the hand of the Sultan sticking out of the ground. The Sultan and all of his friends had been killed, and they never found the murderer. </p>
